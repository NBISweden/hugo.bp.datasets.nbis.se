        <h2>NOTICE (Please read the following notice carefully)</h2>
        This is a prototype website for Dataset description pages / DOI landing pages for Bigpicture.
        <br/>
        This website is openly accessible to Everyone on the Internet, because the purpose of Dataset description pages / DOI landing pages is to be accessible to anyone on the Internet.
        <br/>
        The reason for Dataset description pages / DOI landing pages to be openly accessible to anyone on the Internet, is so that a potential user can learn<br/> 
        1) that a dataset exists,<br/> 
        2) how it can be used, <br/>
        3) why they should bother applying for access, and  how to apply for access.
        <br/>
        This website was set up on instruction from wp3 (data contributor) leadership, with a starting point in the AIDA Data Hub Dataset register format, in order to iterate toward a suitable format for Dataset description pages / DOI landing pages in Bigpicture, in dialogue with the reference group consisting of data contributor representatives, which is authorized by the managing board<br/> 
        to make decisions for this prototype. This will happen in two-week feedback iterations. When the reference group is happy with the format, it will be submitted to the managing board for approval for
    
        integration nto the Bigpicture metadata standard.
